The best polar bear game made in uni of glasgow if you dont mind us bragging

GUTS HACKATHON 2023
Game: Polar bears are the face of climate change
Polar Bear platformer with a finish line, distance meter & time meter.
The ice platform is slowly melting & health will always drain.
Seals will regenerate health but the further you go the less seals will spawn.



Lose
If you run out of health then end the game with a distance score & facts about icebergs melting, polar bear decline & other related facts.
	
	Win
If you reach the end the polar bear will pretend to celebrate & the ice will crumble below him & he will fall in the water with facts printed again. Inspired by PETA’s Can Your Pet

Facts:
WWF - We lose Arctic sea ice at a rate of almost 13% per decade, this makes it difficult for me to hunt. 
Worldwildlife - There has been a 40% population loss for polar bears from 2001-2010
UCAR - projected to decline by further 30% by 2050. 
Clear water innovation - Recycling prevents plastic material from getting into the water & can save the polar bears.
CTV NEWS - It's estimated that up to 80 per cent of the seal pups died last year as a result of thin ice, which means less food for polar bears.
Take Action for Wildlife - The loss of sea ice is the largest threat to polar bears & is caused by pollution activities such as driving, excessive use of energy, and not recycling.
Center for biological diversity - More than  a million species at risk of going extinct due to climate change, one third of plant and animal species threatened by extinction due to climate change
United Nations - Reducing food waste can save climate change & polar bears by reducing methane from landfills which is a powerful greenhouse. Cutting your food waste can reduce your carbon footprint by up to 300 kilograms of CO2e per year. 
ESA - Global ice loss per year (as of 2017) is 1.3 trillion tonnes per year. 41218 tonnes per second. 
Imperial University - By making better food choices, you can reduce your carbon footprint!
17 falafel and pitta meals are equal to 1 cheeseburger worth of CO2 emissions.
Livestock, primarily cows,  produce 14.5% of greenhouse gas emissions. Try reduce your meat intake! 
UNEP - Transport accounts for 25% of greenhouse gas emissions! Could you be making better choices?
Imperial University - Getting a train from London to Amsterdam is 20x more environmentally friendly than flying. 
Amnh - We can save polar bears by reducing global warming such as by driving less & instead relying on walking, cycling or public transport.
Purchases
UNEP - Shop local! Sustainable agriculture uses up to 56 per cent less energy, creates 64 per cent fewer emissions and allows for greater levels of biodiversity than conventional farming.
UNEP - Fashion industry accounts of 8-10% of greenhouse emissions
Avoid fast fashion, try to shop at thrift stores and only make long term purchases. 


Ask your bank if they are investing sustainably
You can opt out of funds investing in fossil fuels. 
WHO - Additional 250,000 human deaths per year forecasted between 2030 and 2050
The earthbound report - The land inhabited by 3.5 billion people could be rendered uninhabitable by 2070.





Level outline:
Level 1 - Polar Bear related facts
I get my primary food (seals, YUM!) from hunting on the ice.
The earth has been losing Arctic sea ice at a rate of almost 13% per decade, this makes it difficult for me to hunt.
Climate change is primarily caused by greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.
Please don’t let me starve…
Level 2 - Impacts of climate change
It's estimated that up to 80 per cent of the seal pups died last year as a result of thin ice, which means less food for polar bears.
There has been a 40% decrease in my fellow polar bear population from 2001-2010.
This is predicted to decrease by a further 30% by 2050.
Please help save my family! 
Level 3 - Global change 
It’s not just me! One-third of plant and animal species are threatened by extinction due to climate change.
An additional 250,000 human deaths are forecasted per year between 2030 and 2050 due to climate change.
The land inhabited by 3.5 billion people could be rendered unlivable by 2070.
Level 4 - 
Time is running out - food is running out for polar bears, their habitat is being ruined, just like for you in this game. 
They’re not alone in this, many animals including humans are going to have limited time left on much of this planet. 
Make a change before it is too late.
